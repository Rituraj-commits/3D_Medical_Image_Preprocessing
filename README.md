# 3D Medical Image Preprocessing

This repository contains a jupyter notebook file for handling 3D Medical Data (NIfTI)

## Description

This repository shows the usage of the pytorch package ```medicaltorch``` for 3D Medical Data. Currently, the notebook contains samples from CHAOS T2SPIR. Other datasets can also be implemented in similar way.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* ``` pytorch==1.3.0 ```
* ```torchdivision==0.4.1```
* ```medicaltorch```

## Dataset
* Download [CHAOS](https://chaos.grand-challenge.org/)
